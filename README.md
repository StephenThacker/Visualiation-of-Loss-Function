# Visualiation-of-Loss-Function
Tensorflow implementation of one of the methods found in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913

The paper, Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural Nets(2017) by Li , provides a variety of methods for visualizing high
dimensional loss functions.The paper provides a github repository containing the described methods. The methods in that repository(https://github.com/tomgoldstein/loss-landscape) are written in Pytorch. Since I 
use tensorflow, I wrote the method that I needed in Tensorflow and provided it here in this repository.

This github respository is a Tensorflow based implementation of the "filter-normalization" method introduced in section 4 of the paper.
